title: Where do I get my tech news?
---

As someone passionate about building great products and teams, it is important to keep myself informed about new and important technologies and practices.

The main channels I use are:

* Link aggregators:
  * Hacker News
  * Lobste.rs
* Social networks:
  * X / Twitter (unfortunately not as good as it used to be)
  * Reddit (mostly for topics that I'm already following, not new topics)
  * LinkedIn (but often boring and pretty useless for technology and innovation)
* Tech news:
  * The Verge
  * Wired
  * TechCrunch
  * LWN.net
* Blog posts (and following links from one blog to another!)
* Some newsletters (often hosted on Medium, or Substack, like _The Pragmatic Engineer_)
* Podcasts
* YouTube
* Google search (searching for a concept or a tech I've read about and finding other articles)
* Wikipedia
* Books (more rarely than in the past)
* I donâ€™t use RSS anymore, but perhaps I should
* Meetups and conferences

Anything you would add to that list?
