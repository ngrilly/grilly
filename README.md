# Todo

- Keep utility-first CSS classes?
- Add a favicon?
- Add link to Threads
- Replace email icon with email address in plain text?
- Migrate ngrilly.substack.com here?
- Let visitors provide feedback â€” like and/or comment? Using email, social networks, HN, giscus or something else?
- Should we fingerprint the stylesheet URL and set `cache-control: public, max-age=31556926` instead of `cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` (Cloud Pages and Netlify's default)?
    - Pro: No need to revalidate the stylesheet on every page load.
    - Con: All HTML files are invalidated on every update of the stylesheet.
